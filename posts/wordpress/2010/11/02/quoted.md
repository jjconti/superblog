</p><blockquote>With this in mind, and inspired by Conti and Russoâ€™s work, we implement a mechanism to perform taint propagation, i.e. how to mark as erasure-aware data that is computed from other erasure-aware values. From now on, we use taint and erasure-aware as interchangeable terms.</blockquote></body></html>
